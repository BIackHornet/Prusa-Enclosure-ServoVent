*This is a work in progress and not currently functional*

Summary:
I am trying to create an automated way of controlling the exhaust vent and fan on my Original Prusa Enclosure. PrusaSlicer has variables that will know what filament
type is being used, that variable will be used in the start and end gcode. Based on the type of filament, the vent will be rotated by a servo and the fan turned on.

Topology:
Raspberry Pi Pico running MicroPython
Prusa Basic Board connected to Pico GPIO with extension cable
Buck Convertor stepping down voltage (24v to 5v) from Basic Board to Pico
PrusaSlicer inserts Start and End G-code to control vent state (open or closed)
Original Prusa MK4/S, MK3.9/S, or MK3.5/S running firmware 6.2.0-alpha1 or newer.

ðŸ”§ PrusaSlicer Start G-code:

; --- Setup GPIO modes ---
M262 P0 B0 ; Pin 0: Exhaust
M262 P1 B0 ; Pin 1: Recirculate
M262 P2 B0 ; Pin 2: Fan toggle output

; --- Reset all outputs ---
M264 P0 B0 ; Exhaust OFF
M264 P1 B0 ; Recirculate OFF
M264 P2 B0 ; Ensure fan toggle is LOW

; --- Simulate pressing FAN button (ON) ---
M264 P2 B1 ; Toggle ON (pull low)
G4 S1       ; Wait 1 second
M264 P2 B0 ; Toggle OFF (release)

; --- Set venting mode based on filament ---
{if initial_filament_type == "PLA"}
  M264 P0 B1 ; Exhaust ON
{elsif initial_filament_type == "PETG"}
  M264 P0 B1 ; Exhaust ON
{elsif initial_filament_type == "TPU"}
  M264 P0 B1 ; Exhaust ON
{elsif initial_filament_type == "ABS"}
  M264 P1 B1 ; Recirculate ON
{elsif initial_filament_type == "ASA"}
  M264 P1 B1 ; Recirculate ON
{elsif initial_filament_type == "Nylon"}
  M264 P1 B1 ; Recirculate ON
{elsif initial_filament_type == "PC"}
  M264 P1 B1 ; Recirculate ON
{else}
  M117 âš  Unknown filament type â€“ check vent manually



ðŸ§¹ PrusaSlicer End G-codes:

; --- Turn off vent outputs ---
M264 P0 B0 ; Exhaust OFF
M264 P1 B0 ; Recirculate OFF

; --- Simulate pressing FAN button (OFF) ---
M264 P2 B1 ; Toggle ON (pull low)
G4 S1       ; Wait 1 second
M264 P2 B0 ; Toggle OFF (release)
